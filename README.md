When you're trying to reach a goal, it can be challenging to figure out which collection of actions are working toward or against your future progress. The power of YQuantify is to find and illuminate these associations using a flexible machine learning pipeline.

As the platform learns more about you, it is able to discover more connections to produce better recommendations. Quantify your actions, process your data, then make improvements using your unique and evolving model's predictions.

## How it works

Sensivity analysis uses taylor series expansion. Let's say the prediction model from the multi-variate regression is <img width="49" alt="math_01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25379378/66709175-07a62000-ed13-11e9-9571-160b6bf1f66e.png">

When Î´x is small, we can neglect the high order terms, and define the first or higher order of approximated functions. In here, we only consider the first order model, which is a linear model.

From the Taylor series expansion, we can get the gradient information.

This gradient can be computed numerically through the small perturbation. <img width="29" alt="math_05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25379378/66709180-0f65c480-ed13-11e9-94b8-8b9e0689fffb.png">
