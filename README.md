When you're trying to reach a goal, it can be challenging to figure out which collection of actions are working toward or against your future progress. The power of YQuantify is to find and illuminate these associations using a flexible machine learning pipeline.

As the platform learns more about you, it is able to discover more connections to produce better recommendations. Quantify your actions, process your data, then make improvements using your unique and evolving model's predictions.
